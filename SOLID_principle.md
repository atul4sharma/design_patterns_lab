## SOLID design principle

- Single Responsibility principle 
  A Class should have only one reason to change 
  Separation of Concerns: different class handling different, independent tasks/problems 

- Open - Closed principle 
  A class should be open for extension but closed for modification 

- Liskov Substitution principle 
  You should be able to substitute a base type for a subtype. 

- Interface segregation principle 
  Don't put too much into an interface, split into separate interfaces. 

- Dependency Inversion principle 
  High level modules should not depend on low-level modules; Use abstractions instead.
